<h2 id="general-overview">GENERAL OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>BG1 Unfinished Business (&quot;BG1UB&quot;) is a mod designed to restore many of the cut items, quests, and encounters from the original Baldur's Gate game's final release, as well as try to tie up some of the &quot;loose ends.&quot; As usual, BG1UB should be compatible with most other WeiDU-based mods, and should be installed after either conversion. BG1UB is compatible with Baldur's Gate 1 (with or without Tales of the Sword Coast), Tutu, BGT, and Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>For version 13+ no additional audio pack is needed. Do not install the separate German, French or Spanish audio packs of earlier releases!</p>
<p>Listed below is an explanation of some of the mod's components:</p>
<p><strong>0. Ice Island Level Two Restoration:</strong> Developed by devSin, this component restores the second level of the Ice Island from the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. In the original release, some of the files for this area were damaged and summarily cut from the original game.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Mysterious Vial:</strong> One of the biggest &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; from the original game involves the &quot;mysterious vial&quot; that you find in the Nashkel Mines. SimDing0 has rectified this, and now we can finally tie up this notorious loose end.</p>
<p><strong>2. Additional Elminster Encounter:</strong> In the original game, a bug prevented an additional encounter with Elminster from occurring. Thanks to SimDing0, however, this should no longer be the case, so expect to meet the famous wizard once more outside of the Friendly Arm Inn.</p>
<p><strong>3. Angelo Notices Shar-teel:</strong> Donated by Ascension64, this component originally appeared in the BGT Tweak Pack. From the BGT Tweak Pack readme: <em>&quot;Father and daughter relationship saves the day when the party is captured by the Flaming Fist.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Finishable Kagain Caravan Quest:</strong> Donated by Ascension64, this component originally appeared in the BGT Tweak Pack. From the BGT Tweak Pack readme: <em>&quot;Finding the son of Duke Entar Silvershield is not a futile wander unless the player waits too long...&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Coran and the Wyverns:</strong> A bug in Coran's original scripting and dialogue caused him to introduce himself over and over again if the player refused his quest. Thanks to this fix by Idobek, Coran should finally recognize that he had already introduced himself. Additionally, the wyverns that Coran want dead have been made unique, preventing the player from killing any wyvern to complete his quest.</p>
<p><strong>6. Kivan and Tazok:</strong> Tazok murdered Kivan's lover, Deheriana, and yet Kivan has nothing to say to Tazok when the party initially meets him in the Bandit Camp. The mourning lover will be silent no more.</p>
<p><strong>7. Branwen and Tranzig:</strong> Tranzig was the man responsible for turning Branwen into a decorative statue at the Nashkel Carnival, and yet she said nothing to him in the original game. After installing this component, the exotic priestess will not be so forgiving.</p>
<p><strong>8. Safana the Flirt:</strong> Donated by Dudley, this component originally appeared in the Dudleyville Tweaks package: <em>&quot;Have you ever wondered why Safana, who chats up the men in your party, and is generally a bit of a babe, has Charm Animal as her innate ability? Well now she has &quot;Flirt&quot; instead, which isn't as reliable as magic but when it does work those who fall for her charms will be very forthcoming.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>9. Appropriate Albert and Rufie Reward:</strong> Different versions of the game and Baldurdash all affected this sequence in the game differently. The original release of the game gave the player a Horn Coral gem. Baldurdash changed it to a bandit scalp. TOTSC broke the dialogue completely. This component should hopefully standardize the reward across the various versions of the game.</p>
<p><strong>10. Place Entar Silvershield in His Home:</strong> On the player's first trip to the city of Baldur's Gate, Entar Silvershield was not in his home, though his murder had not yet occurred. This component, coded by SimDing0, restores him during this timeframe, using dialogue from the original game release that was never implemented.</p>
<p><strong>11. Scar and the Sashenstar's Daughter:</strong> One of the quests given to you by Scar is to investigate the disappearance of people from the city of Baldur's Gate. Included among the missing is the daughter of the Sashenstars. This component will expand upon the quest a bit, allowing you to bring a bit more closure for the family. Special thanks to SixOfSpades for this component's concept.</p>
<p><strong>12. Quoningar, the Cleric:</strong> Quoningar is one of several minor characters that were cut prior to the game's initial release. Thanks to devSin, CHARNAME can now help out this old cleric.</p>
<p><strong>13. Shilo Chen and the Ogre-Magi:</strong> Like Quoningar, Shilo Chen never appeared in the original game, but this component will now allow you to help him with his problem.</p>
<p><strong>14. Edie, the Merchant League Applicant:</strong> Edie, another cut encounter, is trying to get accepted into the Merchant League. Will CHARNAME be able to help her pass her entrance exam?</p>
<p><strong>15. Flaming Fist Mercenary Reinforcements:</strong> The road to Beregost is dangerous these days, so why would a Flaming Fist Mercenary be guarding it alone? Thanks to devSin, this oversight from the original game is now solved.</p>
<p><strong>16. Creature Corrections:</strong> This component contains numerous small edits to many of the game's creature files. Edits include alignment, gender, script, dialogue, death variable, class, and inventory corrections; providing weapons to unarmed creatures; and adds scalps to more bandits.</p>
<p><strong>17. Creature Restorations:</strong> There are many minor NPCs that were not included in the game's original release, and this component restores many of them. Most are generic &quot;scenery&quot; NPCs, but a few will provide important information.</p>
<p><strong>18. Creature Name Restorations:</strong> By digging through various game files, many NPCs can now be given specific names, rather than, for example, &quot;Noblewoman&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>19. Minor Dialogue Restorations:</strong> There are many small pieces of dialogue that never made it to the game's final release, but that is no longer the case due to this component. Also included are reward fixes, Dudley's Hobgoblin Fix (modified to work better) and Ike's Reaction-Based Costs, and modification of dialogues in Chapter 7 that is sensitive to the order in which you perform the quests.</p>
<p><strong>20. Audio Restorations:</strong> Due to some coding bugs, several creature soundsets did not function properly--or at all. devSin has graciously corrected this problem, however, and now Ajantis, Garrick, Xan, Delsvirftanyon, and several other NPCs can be fully heard.</p>
<p><strong>21. Store, Tavern and Inn Fixes and Restorations:</strong> To put it bluntly, stores, taverns, and inns in the original game are a mess. This component restores a few unused stores, assigns the correct bartenders, adds more specific names to the establishments, and fixes an oversight at the Ulgoth's Beard store.</p>
<p><strong>22. Item Corrections and Restorations:</strong> Like the Creature Corrections component, this component contains many fixes and restorations. Several items that were unavailable in the original game have now been added to strategic locations, item-related bugs have been fixed, stores have received new inventory, and item graphics which were previously unused have been restored.</p>
<p><strong>23. Area Corrections and Restorations:</strong> This is a rather small component, but installing it will introduce the Halfling Enforcers, alter the Firedrake trap in Durlag's Tower, and fix the game crashing bug for AR0717 (courtesy of Idobek).</p>
<p><strong>24. Permanent Corpses:</strong> A few encounters in the game, such as the Ogre Mage in the Cloakwood Mines, involved corpses, but because of a coding issue, these corpses would disappear prematurely. Installing this component will make some of the more important corpses in the game permanent.</p>
<p><strong>25. Elven Charm &amp; Sleep Racial Resistance:</strong> TOTSC/TOS ONLY. Courtesy of CamDawg, this component restores the natural resistance that Elves and Half-Elves should have toward charm and sleep spells. Elves gain 90% resistance and Half-Elves 30%.</p>
<p><strong>26. The Original Saga Music Playlist Corrections:</strong> TOS ONLY. The Original Saga, the re-release of the original Baldur's Gate that included the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, had an error regarding in-game music, which this component should correct. Quote Dudley: <em>&quot;A couple of respondents have noted that the 3CD Original Saga contains duplicate MUS files in certain instances. It is believed all MUS files should be unique.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>27. Sarevok's Diary Corrections:</strong> SixOfSpades has spent a lot of time overhauling Sarevok's Diary and a few related documents so that the dates make a bit more sense, and this component is the result of his effort. It will also correct some of the inconsistency regarding Sarevok's last name (Anchev vs. Costak).</p>
<p><strong>28. Prism and the Emeralds Tweak:</strong> This new component was provided by plainab. Features are: it fixes the exploit of being able to turn in Prism's emeralds one at a time by making them unique items; it provides new options to obtain the emeralds; it provides split rewards if the player is only able to obtain one of the emeralds; it puts the emeralds in the sculpture's eyes if Prism finished it.</p>
<p><strong>29. Duke Eltan in the Harbor Master's Building:</strong> This new component was provided by Balquo and jastey. Duke Eltan has so far unused dialogue states for thanking the PC after bringing him to the Harbor Master, so this component makes sure he appears after being brought there so he can actually say them. This component is compatible with the BG1RE component &quot;Duke Eltan's Spare Minute&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>30. Nim Furlwing Encounter:</strong> This new component was provided by AstroBryGuy. In the Wood of Sharp Teeth, a elven hunter and her hounds need your help. Can you save them before it's too late?</p>
<p><strong>31. Restored Elfsong Tavern Movie:</strong> This new component was provided by Sams and AstroBryGuy. This component restores an unfinished movie that was to be played upon entering the Elfsong Tavern. This component is or BG/BGT/Tutu installs only. BGEE users should check out Sams' BG:EE Classic Movies mod.</p>
<p><strong>32. Svlast, the Fallen Paladin Encounter:</strong> This new component was provided by AstroBryGuy. An ex-paladin by the name of Svlast is being hunted in the night near the Firewine Ruins. Can you help him?</p>
<p><strong>33. Mal-Kalen, the Ulcaster Ghost:</strong> This new component was provided by AstroBryGuy. The spirit of Mal-Kalen haunts the depths of the Ulcaster Ruins.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY</h2>
<p>We are striving to make BG1 Unfinished Business compatible with as many other mods as possible. Some BG1 Unfinished Business components contain checks for BG1 NPC Project and Northern Tales of the Sword Coast to prevent mod conflicts. Currently there are no other known incompatibilities with Tutu or BGT mods.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQS</h2>
<p>Q: What do I need to use this mod?<br />A: This version of BG1 Unfinished Business will require BG1, BG1Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy.</p>
<p>Q: Where did you find the information on these cut quests?<br />A: Most of our information came from from delving deep in the dialogue and script files for the game. There are many remnants of creatures and conversations that hint at things that were planned, but never implemented.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you decide to develop this mod?<br />A: The inspiration behind this mod's development springs from my borderline obsessive-compulsive desire for things to be complete. After the success of the Unfinished Business mod for Baldur's Gate II, making the equivalent for the initial game in the Baldur's Gate series seemed like a logical next step.</p>
<p>Q: Who is behind Unfinished Business's development?<br />A: The mod was started by myself, Erik Manning (a.k.a. icelus). After I publicly announced my desire to begin the mod, help came flooding in from people like SimDing0, devSin, SixOfSpades, and many others. This mod, like its BG2 predecessor, is truly a community effort.</p>
<p>Q: What items have been restored with this mod?<br />A: There were actually less than we initially believed, but as of the current release, the restored items are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>BOLT OF POLYMORPHING<br /></li>
<li>BRACERS<br /></li>
<li>CLUB +1, +3 VS. UNNATURAL CREATURES (&quot;THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM&quot;)<br /></li>

<li><p>BUGFIXES</p>
<ul>

<li>Update to WeiDU v236<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Version 13.2<br /></li>
<li><p>CHANGES</p>
<ul>
<li>BG-version: &quot;Minor Dialogue Restorations&quot; Compatibility with Dudleyfixes: Several charmed dialogues fixed so gifts are not doubled<br /></li>
<li>BG: item creation via script did not work because of the spaces in the container names - fixed.<br /></li>
<li>BGT-version: &quot;Minor Dialog Restoration&quot; several charmed dialogue restorations tweaked so gifts are no longer given doubled<br /></li>
<li>BG/BGT/Tutu: &quot;Appropriate Albert and Rufie Reward&quot; Albert now will give a horn coral gem as a reward. Also tweaked the component so that Albert only gives one reward for BGT and BG with Baldurdash.<br /></li>
<li>BG: corrected lib entry, to enable correct journal entries in Prologue<br /></li>
<li>BG: overwrites in-game scroll Raise Dead (SCRL63.itm), so now it works (Please note: works only at the place of the NPC's death. The NPC will be created next to the PC (also, if the PC is further away. I did not test what happens if the PC is in a different area, but I guess this will lead to problems. Important: The scroll is only applicable for the same game. You cannot save and reload! Inside the same game, leavng and re-entering the area of the death site seems to be no problem.)<br /></li>
<li>BGT/Tutu: &quot;Prism&quot;: Journal entried of Prism quest should now be correctly erased after turning the gems in. (Changed the custom tphs for the Prism component: giving the OUTER_SPRINT variables unique names to prevent mixup with the ones from the lib, although that was not necessary, and changed the REPLACE method to replacing high numbers with string references in the tp2 because REPLACE_TRANS_ACTIOn does not evaluate tra-references, which did the trick. Also, the folder structure and the place of INCLUDE for the Prism tpas was changed slightly.<br /></li>
<li>Polish: for BG1, the correct text format is applied - by Zed Nocear<br /></li>
<li>Prism and the Emeralds Tweak: Added fix to make install order for bg1ub and BG1NPC Project / Gavin no longer a problem (Added a REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT for the whole Oublek.dlg and Prism.dlg to account for new states introduced by NPC mods doing I_C_T with passback line (namely BG1NPC Project and Gavin))<br /></li>
